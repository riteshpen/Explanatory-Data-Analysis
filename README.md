# Explanatory-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project is an explanatory data analysis project using Pandas library in Python. Using the data about different variables
that could affect housing prices in the United States. My goal is to see if there is indeed a relationship between lot frontage number, lot area,
living area, and the sale price. I ran a hypothesis test to see if there was a statistically significant relationship between number of fireplaces and sales price of home.
